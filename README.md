# Godot-3.3.3_LightMapGodot3.2.2
Godot 3.3.3 with BakedLight that works on 32bit Systems

Download the source code of godot 3.3.3

clone this repository, in a separate place, copy the editor/ and scene/ and doc/  files and paste in the root of godot and overwrite

Then follow the godot build instructions as normal


This way you will be able to use the BakedLight node from version 3.2.2 in version 3.3.3, as the bakedlight from version 3.3.3 godot does not support 32 bits.

You can use the templates downloaded from the editor, you don't need to compile, but if you have any problems, take a look here:
