# Godot-3.3.3_LightMapGodot3.2.2
Godot 3.3.3 with BakedLight that works on 32bit Systems

Download the source code of godot 3.3.3

clone this repository, in a separate place, copy the editor/ and scene/ files and paste in the root of godot and overwrite

Then follow the godot build instructions as normal


This way you will be able to use the BakedLight node from version 3.2.2 in version 3.3.3, as the bakedlight from version 3.3.3 godot does not support 32 bits.

Note: It will also be necessary to compile the export templates for it to work perfectly.

If @Calinou was good people, here you can find the export models:
